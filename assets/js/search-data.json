    "title": "Problem Statement",
    "content": "Mars is being invaded by Venusians. Here’s a description of the Venusian fleet: . | Each ship has a serial number, a crew, which is a list of Venusians, and a possibly-empty set of daughter ships, each of which is a ship. | Each Venusian has a name, which is a string, and a VSN (Venusian Security Number), which is a number. | When we say “fleet”, we mean a list of ships and their daughters, their daughters’ daughters, etc. | When we say the “fleet of a ship”, we mean the fleet consisting of its daughters. | . EXAMPLE: if ship 1 has daughters ship 11 and ship 12, and ship 11 has daughters 111 and 112, and ship 112 has daughters 1121 and 1122, and none of these ships has any other daughters, then the fleet of ship 1 consists of 1, 11, 12, 111, 112, 1121, and 1122 . Your task is to define TypeScript class Venusian and Ship as follows: . | The class Venusian has a contructor new Venusian(name:string) that returns a Venusian with the given name and a unique VSN. By “unique”, we mean that while your program is running, it must never re-use a VSN. It is OK for your program to re-use the same VSNs if you stop the program and run it again (it need not be a “globally unique” identifier). Venusian names are case-senstive. The class Venusian has the following public methods: . | getName():string returns the name of the Venusian. | getVsn():number returns the VSN of the given Venusian | . | The class Ship has a constructor new Ship(crew:Venusian[], daughters:Ship[]) that returns a ship with the given crew, the given daughters, and a unique serial number (similar to VSNs, the serial number need not be globally unique). The class Ship has the following public methods: . | getCrew():Venusian[] returns the crew of the ship. | getDaughters():Ship[] returns the daughters of the ship. | getSerialNumber():number returns the serial number of the ship | hasWaldo():boolean returns true iff the ship has one or more crew members named Waldo. | totalWaldos():number returns the number of Venusians named “Waldo” that are in the ship or its fleet. Venusians can be in two places at once, so if two Waldos have same VSN, you should count them twice. | removeWaldos():void removes any Venusians named “Waldo” from the crew of the ship. | removeDeepWaldos():void removes any Venusians named Waldo from the crews of the given ship and its fleet. | fleetHasDuplicates():boolean It has come to the attention of the Venusian fleet command that some shipbuilders have been cheating by putting multiple ships with the same serial number in the fleets of their ships. Given a ship, determines whether there are any duplicates among the ship and its fleet. The duplicates may occur anywhere in the ship and its fleet.` | . | . EXAMPLE: in the example above, there are no duplicates. If ship 12 were added to the daughters of ship 111, that would be a duplicate, and applying this function to ship 1 would return true. ",

    "title": "Overview",
    "content": "Building, delivering and maintaining successful software products requires more than being good at programming. Software engineering encompasses the tools and processes that we use to design, construct and maintain programs over time. Software engineering has been said to consider the “multi person development of multi version programs.” Development processes that work well for a single developer do not scale to large or even medium-sized teams. Similarly, development processes that work well for quickly delivering a one-off program to a client cause chaos when applied to a codebase that needs to be maintained and updated over months and years. This class will begin to explore these tradeoffs throughout the entire software development lifecycle, with a particular focus on how these decisions affect the quality of the resulting software. This class will serve as an introduction to the field of software engineering, covering key topics such as: . | Requirements gathering and specification How to make sure that you build the product that your customer really wants | Designing code for reuse, for readability, and for scale How to avoid reinventing the wheel? What makes code readable? Where does performance fit into designs? When do we decide when to revisit old design decisions, and how do we replace them? Can we avoid the mistakes that past developers have made? | How to organize your development process to collaborate effectively How do we communicate our designs with others? How do we structure and coordinate development activities? How do we measure the performance of these processes, and tweak them over time? | How to ensure that your code works, is secure, and broadly speaking, “does the right thing” How do we measure different quality attributes like usability, scalability and performance? How do we minimize the cost of defects? How do we automatically test complex systems? Can we automatically prove the absence of some kinds of defects? | . ",

The codebase that we’ll be developing on is a remote collaboration tool called Covey.Town. Covey.Town provides a virtual meeting space where different groups of people can have simultaneous video calls, allowing participants to drift between different conversations, just like in real life. Covey.Town is inspired by existing products like Gather.Town, Sococo, and Gatherly.IO — but it is an open source effort, and the features will be proposed and implemented by you! All implementation will take place in the TypeScript programming language, using React for the user interface. At the end of the semester, the instructors and TAs will evaluate all of the student projects, and select the best (in terms of usability, code quality, test suite quality, and overall design) to merge into the open source Covey.Town codebase on GitHub repository. No additional course credit will be awarded to these teams, but these students will have the opportunity to receive public recognition for their project (in the form of a pull request merged into our repository and acknowledgements in the project’s contributors list). The project will provide hands-on experience to complement the skills taught in this class, requiring students to be able to: . | Work effectively in a small team | Enumerate and prioritize development tasks | Propose, design, implement and test a new feature in an existing non-toy software application | Write code that their team members can read and review | Review teammates’ code | Analyze a proposed software architecture | Use relevant software tools, such as: . | TypeScript | Visual Studio Code (or similar IDE) | Git | Mocha and Jest | Twilio’s Programmable Video API | Postman | . | . Select projects from Spring 2021 are hosted in our project showcase. Acknowledgements . This class and its contents were inspired by Software Engineering courses at various institutions, including: . | Columbia’s Software Engineering Course, COMS W4156 | CMU’s Software Engineering Course, 17-313 | GMU’s Web App Development Course, SWE 432 | NCSU’s Software Engineering Course, CSC 326 and its iTrust term project, also Chris Parnin’s DevOps course. | Past iterations of CS5500 at Northeastern, as prepared by Mike Weintraub, Mike Shah, and Frank Tip. | .

    "doc": "Code Style",
    "title": "Code Style",
    "content": "Programs are easier to read and to understand when they are written in a familiar style and follow standard coding conventions. Most organizations that develop software therefore require programmers to write programs that follow the organization’s preferred style and coding conventions. These conventions can be very elaborate. Many of the guidelines are, in fact, arbitrary. When you are working on a coding project with other developers, different developers often have preference for slightly different syntax, for instance: should our string litterals be enclosed by single quotes (') or double quotes (\")? Should files be indented with spaces or tabs? In TypeScript, there are often multiple ways to accomplish the same goal, for instance, you could create a new empty array with the expression const myArray = new Array(), or const myArray = []. Sometimes there is no difference between these variants except for how it reads, and other times there may be unintended consequences of making the seemingly correct but subtly wrong choice. Thankfully, it is possible to write automated checkers (and, at times, fixers) for these style violations. All code that you write for this class will be checked by ESLint, and must be free of style warnings and errors. Our ESlint rules are derived from Airbnb’s JavaScript Style Guide, ESLint’s Recommended Rules, TypeScript/ESLint Recommended Rules, React ESLint Rules and React Hooks ESLint Rules. We do not suggest studying these lists directly, instead, begin writing code naturally, and allow your IDE’s built-in style checker to report issues as you find them. The most important rules to get started are: . | Indent using spaces, not tabs; use 2 spaces for each level of indentation | Enclose all string literals with single quotes, not double | Variables must be named using lowerCamelCase, types are named using UpperCamelCase. Constants (read-only variables that are assigned a static value once and not reused) must be named using UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES. | The maximum line length is 100 characters | . Naming . While the linter can automatically flag names that violate camelCase rules, it can not automatically determine that a name is “good” - this is a subjective judgement call. Please consider the following when choosing names: . | Names for types are typically nouns or noun phrases. Interface names, however, might be adjectives (e.g. Serializable). | Function names are typically verbs or verb phrases | Variable and property names should be descriptive of what the variable is for, and not be named after the type of the variable (which is captured in the variable’s type declaration) | Names for properties that are private must start with a _ | . Documentation and Comments . All public properties and methods (other than getters, setters, and constructors) must be documented using JSDoc-style comments that describes what the property/method does. Example: . /** The unique identifier for this player * */ private readonly _id: string; . /** * A handler to process a remote player's subscription to updates for a room * * @param socket the Socket object that we will use to communicate with the player */ . Consider adding comments within your code to describe non-obvious behavior, or to capture why the code is written the way that it is. Do not add comments that simply restate what can already be immediately discerned by reading the code. For example, here is a useful comment: . // No valid session exists for this token, hence this client's connection should be terminated socket.disconnect(true); return; . Here is a useless comment on the same code snippet: . // Disconnect the socket socket.disconnect(true); return; . Comments are for documentation, not for keeping track of old code you are no longer using (do not submit commented-out code). ",

    "content": "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. For this class, you will need Node.js version 16 (16.13.2 is the latest version at time of writing, although any 16.x shoudl work in theory). There are many ways that you can install Node.js: for instance, you can use a package manager like snap or homebrew to install it; you can download an installer directly from the Node.js website, and you can, of course, build it from source. However, due to the complexity of running different Node.js versions on the same machine, we very strongly suggest using nvm, as explained below. We recommend installing Node.js using nvm, the node version manager. When language runtimes are in active development (like Node.js is), sometimes you end up needing to have multiple versions of Node.js installed, and different projects that you work on might require different versions of Node.js. These annoyances are quite rare, but when it happens that you need to have mutliple versions of Node.js installed, it’s super handy to have your system set up already so that installing multiple versions and switching between it is easy. You can use our instructions to set up nvm even if you have previously installed Node.js. ",

Troubleshooting with VSCode: Did you follow these instructions successfully, but find a “Command not found” error when you try to run npm in VSCode? Try this: Close VSCode completely. Re-open it. In your command shell in VSCode, try again. We have noticed that if you have VSCode open while installing nvm, it is possible that VSCode will not see the new software installation until it’s closed and re-opened. You can also confirm that VSCode correctly sees the NodeJS installation by running echo %PATH% in your windows command shell in VSCode: it should include an entry similar to C:\\Program Files\\nodejs.
